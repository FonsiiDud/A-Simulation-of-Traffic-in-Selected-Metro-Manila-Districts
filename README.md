# A-Simulation-of-Traffic-in-Selected-Metro-Manila-Districts
Project showcasing a simulation of selected Metro Manila districts as a requirement in my CSCI 115 - Computer Simulation and Modeling Class

# About the Project
The base of this project is a fork from [trafficSimulator](https://github.com/BilHim/trafficSimulator), where it simulates driver behavior using the Intelligent Driver model. More information regarding this Github project can be seen in this [article](https://towardsdatascience.com/simulating-traffic-flow-in-python-ee1eab4dd20f). This project merely uses the trafficSimulator as a base to simulate the Metro Manila Business Districts of Oritgas and Makati to gather key observations in their respective road networks.
